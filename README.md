# reserver
creating my new fullstack mern app with express node react redux and mongodb

- clone the project 
- open terminal in root reserver directory and hit npm install
- open terminal in client directory and hit npm install 
- backend server uses mongodb atlas so you need to create a mongo atlas account and place the connection key and a jwt secret as an object into default.json in reserver/config folder













Enjoy!
